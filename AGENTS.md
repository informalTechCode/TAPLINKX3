# Agent Guidelines

- Always start work in the repository root (`/workspace/TAPLINKX3`). Run `pwd` to confirm and `cd /workspace/TAPLINKX3` if needed before executing commands.
- Use the Gradle wrapper (`./gradlew`) from the root when running builds or tests so relative paths resolve correctly.
- Keep documentation concise and actionable when describing setup or environment steps.
